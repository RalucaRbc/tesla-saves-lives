# The initial story
(it needs worked on)

The problem
	Every year, toxic air pollution	causes 
	5,500,000 early deaths worldwide,
	40,000 in the UK, 9,000 in London.

The numbers
	There are more than 1.2 billion cars worldwide
	that produce toxic air pollution, which cause
	5,500,000 deaths all around the world.
	- Refactor

The math
	Devide the number of cars to the total deaths number
	to get that each group of 218 gasoline drivers are responsible	
	for the early death of one of their own.
	- Refactor
The light
	By driving an electric car like Tesla, 
	each 218 EV owners negate that number and 
	save a life each year.
